# Child-Nutrition-and-health-Monitoring-Dashboard-on-Power-Bi

"Suchona" is a multisectoral nutrition program that works to prevent chronic malnutrition in children. As an intern I was tasked to investigate the KPI's of the Suchona dataset, calculate children BMI and other health indicators based on WHO standard, clean and visualize them through using Power Bi and develop a classification model to identify the severity of malnutrition in children and also rank the upazilas of Bangladesh based on the severity of the areas.
